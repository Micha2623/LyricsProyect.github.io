            <p> Feeling my way through the darkness<br>
                Guieded by a beating heart<br>
                I don't know where the journey will end<br>
                But I know where to start<br>
                They say I'm too young to understand<br>
                They say I'm caught up in a dream<br>
                My life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes<br>
                Well its fine by me.
            </p>
            <p>
                So wake me up when it's all over<br>
                When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
                All this time I was finding myself and I <br>
                Didn't knew I was lost<br>
                So wake me up when it's all over<br>
                When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
                All this time I was finding myself and I <br>
                Didn't knew I was lost.
            </p>

            <p>
                I tried carrying the weight of the world <br>
                But I only have two hands<br>
                I hope to get the chance to travel the world<br>
                But I don't have any plans <br>
                Wish that I could stay forever this young<br>
                Not afraid to close my eyes<br>
                <i> <strong>Life's a game made for everyone<br>
                        And love is the price.</strong></i>
            </p>
            <p> So wake me up when it's all over <br>
                When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
                All this time I was finding myself and I <br>
                Didn't knew I was lost<br>
                So wake me up when it's all over <br>
                When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
                All this time I was finding myself and I <br>
                Didn't knew I was lost.<br>
