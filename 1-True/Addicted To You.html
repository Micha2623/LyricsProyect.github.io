            <p>
                I don′t know just how it happened<br>
                I let down my guard<br>
                Swore I'd never fall in love again<br>
                But I fell hard<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Guess I should have seen it coming<br>
                Caught me by surprise<br>
                Wasn′t looking where I was going<br>
                I fell into your eyes<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                You came into my crazy world<br>
                Like a cool and cleansing wave<br>
                Before I, I knew what hit me, baby<br>
                You were flowing through my veins<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm addicted to you<br>
                Hooked on your love<br>
                Like a powerful drug<br>
                I can't get enough of<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Lost in your eyes<br>
                Drowning in blue<br>
                Out of control<br>
                What can I do<br>
                I′m addicted to you<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Midnight blows in through the window<br>
                Dances ′round the room<br>
                Got me hypnotized<br>
                I'm getting high on love with you<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I couldn′t live without you now<br>
                Oh, I know I'd go insane<br>
                I wouldn′t last one night alone, baby<br>
                I couldn't stand the pain<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I′m addicted to you<br>
                Hooked on your love<br>
                Like a powerful drug<br>
                I can't get enough of<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Lost in your eyes<br>
                Drowning in blue<br>
                Out of control<br>
                What can I do?<br>
                I'm addicted to you<br>
            </p>
